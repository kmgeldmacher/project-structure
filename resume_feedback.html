  <!-- First thing: the page is missing HTML5 structural elements, so
       up here, you'd want to wrap your name, contact information
       in a 'header' tag; your navigation in a 'nav' tag; the sections
       below that in 'section' tags.

       I understand why you added the non-breaking spaces, but 
       remember, styling will handle this down the line. On the plus 
       side, you encoded them properly! On the down side you can 
       eliminate them. 

       You can use an 'a' tag to create a link for your address which 
       would allow someone to click on it and send you an email. You 
       should still look into how one does that, but that method is a 
       way spammers harvest email addresses, so... instead, try using
       http://hivelogic.com/enkoder/ to include a link to your
       email address.

    <!-- Really good job here with navigation. You are just missing the
         'nav' tag.

         The values for each anchor are good. These also show up in 
         a url bar when they are clicked:

         resume.html#skills

         That's kind of an added bonus for user interface and 
         experience. (On that note; maybe go with #references instead of
         #refs.) So really good job here.

    <!-- Missing the 'alt' description here. Always provide some text
         that describes the image, for instance:

         alt="A portrait of Kate."

         It is helpful for anyone who is using a screen reader to know
         what is on the page, especially if the image is an infographic
         or part of navigating the site.
